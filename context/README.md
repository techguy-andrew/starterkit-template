# Context Folder System Example

Welcome to the **context-example** folder! This is a portable documentation system template for any development project.

## üìÅ Structure Overview

- `README.md`: This file. Navigation hub and system overview.
- `PROJECT.md`: Core project context (what, why, who)
- `SETUP.md`: Getting started guide
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Technical decisions and stack
- `ROADMAP.md`: Current status and future plans
- `.ai-rules`: Rules for AI assistants
- `decisions/`: Important decisions with rationale (see _templates/decision.md)
