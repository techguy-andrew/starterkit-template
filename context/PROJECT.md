## Executive Summary

> A professional Next.js 15 starter template for rapid development of modern SaaS, membership, and dashboard applications. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI components for maximum developer productivity and customization.

## Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** Developers spend weeks setting up the same boilerplate code for every new project - authentication, dashboard layouts, UI components, type safety, testing, and deployment configurations.
- **Solution:** A comprehensive, production-ready starter template that provides all essential features out-of-the-box with modular architecture and easy customization through configuration files and setup scripts.

- Full-stack developers building SaaS applications
- Frontend developers creating dashboard applications
- Development teams needing rapid prototyping capabilities
- Indie developers and startups launching new products
- Agencies building client projects with consistent architecture

## Key Features

- Next.js 15 with App Router and React 19
- TypeScript with strict mode for type safety

- Modular dashboard system with 6 pre-built views
- Authentication system ready for NextAuth.js integration
- Professional landing page and marketing pages
- Configuration-driven customization system
- Comprehensive testing setup with Jest

## Success Metrics

- GitHub stars and template usage adoption
- Developer time saved (target: 80% reduction in setup time)
- Community contributions and active users

## AI Assistant Context

- This is a starter template, not a specific business application
- Focus on maintainable, reusable code patterns
- Template variables ({{VARIABLE_NAME}}) are used for customization
- Configuration files in `src/config/` control features and behavior
- Components should be modular and easily customizable
- Always run `pnpm lint:fix` and `pnpm type-check` before committing changes
- Use the setup script `./scripts/setup-template.sh` for template customization
